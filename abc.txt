This project demonstrates a simple Text to Speech application using Python and the gTTS library.

The script reads text from this file and converts it into spoken audio using Google's Text-to-Speech API. The output is saved as an MP3 file and played automatically.

This type of application can be useful for:
- Visually impaired users who need text read aloud
- Creating voice content from written material
- Making educational tools or reading assistants

Developed using:
- Python
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- OS module for playback
